#### Summary

Blocipedia is my second Bloc project, an app that allows users to create their own wikis and invite collaborators to contribute to the wikis.


#### Explanation

Blocipedia allows users to create a free account and create wiki’s using Markdown. Accounts can be upgraded to a premium membership where a user can create private wiki’s and add collaborators to help edit the wiki.

#### Problem

Wikipedia allows users to contribute to creating and collaborating on content. However, all content must be verified and referenced, and therefore unsuitable for the creation of private wikis.


#### Solution

Blocipedia allows users to create multiple wikis. The site supports markdown which gives users more tools to create readable content. If members upgrade to a Premium membership, they can create private wikis and invite collaborators.

#### Conclusion

I used Devise for user authentication and it worked fine. And I finally learned how to accept process payments using Stripe, a skill that I'm eager to incorporate into my own web app for selling online tickets.
