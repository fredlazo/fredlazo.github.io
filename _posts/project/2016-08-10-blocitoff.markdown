#### Explanation
This was my first project I worked on by myself with help from my Bloc mentor. I created a real web app utilizing everything I learned in Bloc's Rails/Backend curriculum.

#### Problem

Although many people use to-do lists, the tendency is to put things off and make the excuse that we'll do things at a later time. The reality is that we end up with long to-do lists full of items that we never get around to doing.


#### Solution

This application self-destructs all your to-do items after one week. The think is that if it's not done in a week, it'll probably never get done.


#### Results

I tried using the app myself, but I found that as items approached the one week deadline, I would simply add the item again to the bottom of the to list, giving me a one-week extension.  


#### Conclusion

I learned a lot about Rails and the Devise Authorization Gem. I also learned that I should probably add a feature that allows a user to 'renew' and create an extension of perhaps a day or two.
