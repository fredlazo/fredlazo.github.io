#### Explanation
This was the first project I did by myself. I worked on this project for 3 weeks as a goal to improve my overall coding ability, and to learn what it was like to produce a real web application without constant aid. I worked on this site primarily with my mentor Phil at Bloc.io.

#### Problem

Everyone uses to-do lists but tend to put things off and we say that we'll do things at a later time. We tend to think that it will get done at some point.


#### Solution

This application self-destructs to-do items that are a week old. The philosophy is that you should do it within a week, and if you donâ€™t you probably will never get around to it. This makes users more accountable for their to-do items, and forces them to think of completing things that are going to be destroyed soon.


#### Results

As this application was a project to improve coding ability and learning. I have not had any chance to put the application in the hands of users that use it consistently. Results at the moment are based completely on personal use. I find that using the Blocitoff utility did want me to complete tasks before a week was over.


#### Conclusion

I learned a lot about Rails and the Devise Authorization Gem. I learned how to think of object more clearly, and how to implement different types of ideas into practical use.
