Grrrrrr

I’m sitting here in front of my laptop blogging, not because I _want_ to blog, but because I _have_ to blog.

It’s a requirement for my online coding class that I create three blogs of at least 500 words each to show my “personality and passion’ for coding.  


But don’t you think someone with a passion for coding, would rather be **CODING** instead of **BLOGGING** about coding!?

I wonder if bloggers have a coding section in their blog websites.  You know, where they write software that demonstrates their ‘personality and passion’ for blogging.

Sorry for the sarcasm and negative vibes, but I feel like I’m wasting my time, especially when there’s a good chance that nobody will ever read these blogs.  But if I want to get to the next part of the course --- Frontend (HTML & JavaScript) --- I have to complete my online portfolio which includes a blog section. And it's taking me **FOR-EH-VURRR!!**

_Let’s see, how many words do I have left before I can start coding again?_

According to word count, I need 340 more words before I start coding again.?!?!?

**Grrrrrrr.**

Make that 339 words.

You know what --- why wait?  I’ll just start coding right here:

```ruby
def things_that_suck(thing)
    return 'sucks' if thing == 'blogging'
end

things_that_suck('blogging')

=> 'sucks'
```
Okay, I got that out of my system.  

I’ll stop being grumpy and I'll try to have a positive attitude about this.  I just have to remember that an employer might want to get a feel for what my personality is like considering I’ll be working with them on a daily basis.  So, I guess I better lighten up and portray myself as someone who won’t rip your head off if asked to write a blog.


By the way...you know what rhymes with "blogging"?

Flogging.

You know what rhymes with "coding"?

Apple Pie a la Mode-ing.
