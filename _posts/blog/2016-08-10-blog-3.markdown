I've finally completed the Ruby on Rails portion of the Software Engineering Track.  

<!--more-->

I've done two Rails projects, got my portfolio set up and I've already been looking at potential jobs.  But even though I've completed the structured portion of the rails curriculum and completed the two required projects, I'm going to attempt the other Rails projects.  In fact, I'm going to try to do all of the Rails projects. I'm even going to redo my old projects (Bloccit, Blocipedia and Blocitoff) because I find that every time I redo a project, I always learn something new.
